#Description

As an MMO player, I know how hard it is to keep track of what you want and how to get it. This is the first version of the solution to that problem. Import your character from the Final Fantasy XIV API (currently only Malboro) and import your Gear, then start adding what you want to get to your tracker at the bottom of the page. This will be updated more as I go along.
